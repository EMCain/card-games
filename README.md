# card-games
JavaScript modules defining Deck and Card prototypes.

I made this project as an example of object-oriented JavaScript. Currently the only game is Blackjack; I recently upgraded it to include betting and to display a game's outcome more clearly, as well as some other UI fixes.  

Possible ideas for using or extending this:
* upgrade the CSS to display full-sized cards in a more appealing design
* create other card games
* include the option for Jokers in Deck, or a Deck that is multiple 52-card decks combined

Feel free to submit a pull request with any of the above ideas, or show me what you've made in a separate project.

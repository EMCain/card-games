JavaScript modules defining Deck and Card prototypes.

I made this project as an example of object-oriented JavaScript. As of this writing (7 June 2016) the only game I've made is the Blackjack game, and it doesn't have a betting mechanism. However, I designed the Card and Deck functions to be used for any game with a standard 52-card deck.

Possible ideas for using or extending this: 
* upgrade the CSS to display full-sized cards in a more appealing design
* add a betting mechanism to Player
* create other card games
* include the option for Jokers in Deck, or a Deck that is multiple 52-card decks combined

Feel free to submit a pull request with any of the above ideas, or show me what you've made in a separate project.
